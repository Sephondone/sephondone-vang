	<p> These are some of the games that I enjoy playing.</p>

			<p> League of legends is one of my favorite games to play with my friends. It's a game based on a 5v5 pvp gamemode where you have to destroy the other teams nexus. It contains about 140 different characters called Champions each with their own different ablilities and their own types of playstyle.<p>

			<img src = "images/pokemon games.png"

			 <p>Pokemon is also another favorite of mine, it's a game where you catch these creatures called Pokemon. In this game you go around catching pokemon and leveling them up and teaching them new moves they will learn by level ups or teaching them moves by using "tm" which is called a technical move which you can find on the ground or buy from a shop in the game. Your main goal is to defeat all 8 gym leaders and then go off to defeat the elite 4 which is a group of trainers that are the best in the game, once you are done with that you can go try and catch all 151 different pokemon in the game.<p>

		<p> Call of Duty is also one of my favorite games that i enjoy playing. I've played this game since Call of Duty 3. And so far I've enjoyed the series even though the game itself has been made by some other companies and some of the games were not as great as others. Overall though I really enhoy the game, it has been slowly over time getting a little bored but for some reason the game itself has still got me hooked onto it.<p>
